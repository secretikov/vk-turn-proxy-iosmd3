// AdvancedView.swift
//
// The "Advanced" screen, pushed from SettingsView. Home for settings that are
// opt-in, experimental, or otherwise not part of the everyday flow. Only the
// Live Activity switch lives here for now; more are expected.
//
// 🚨 Read reference: "SwiftUI pop rule" before adding anything here.
//
// This screen is PUSHED (Content → Settings → Advanced), and writing an
// @AppStorage key from a pushed screen is harmless — re-rendering a pushed view
// does not disturb the navigation stack. What is NOT harmless is letting
// ContentView observe the same key: ContentView hosts the NavigationView, and
// any re-render of it tears down whatever is pushed. That is exactly how build
// 177 and GitHub #65 happened.
//
// So the rule for every key added here: declare it on THIS screen (and wherever
// it is consumed below the navigation links), never in ContentView. Consumers
// that are not views read it through UserDefaults.standard instead.
